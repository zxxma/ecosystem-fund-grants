## Why are you best suited/what is your background (or teamâ€™s if applicable) (applies to all submissions)?
- Our team members are full-time engineers in blockchain ecosystem for +4 years and more than 5years in Golang.
- Teritori team is working for 2 years now on an open source project (built in public) which gather around 16 features adressing needs of users and organisations.
- Team is composed of Senior engineers, Senior Product Manager, Senior UX/UI Designer, and Senior Front end Engineers with a strong passion for decentralized organisations.

## Milestones and overall time frame of your proposal
Milestones are set at a time frame of 5 months.

### Milestone #1 - Road to Mainnet (Gno Core Contributions)
NOTE: These are essential features needed for mainnet and dApps. It requires co-working with core developers & contributors to complete. We will do our best to contribute to completing these features by actively participating in development, providing insights, and helping other developers who are already working on it.
### Onchain Project Manager Module v0.1
Onchain task management contracts
This feature allow an organization to manage projects securely and transparently. 

> Through modular Gno contracts, and a Kanban like interface, this tool will ensure visibility in the monitoring of decentralized projects. 
Prioritary use cases identified to date are: 
> - Grant Program management
> - Services marketplace for freelancers, etc.
> - Management of a DAO's internal project, requiring collective decision-making for follow-up and payment.
> - ... others will be added, so don't hesitate to contribute.

- **Gnolang Contracts Ecosystem:** 
    - Each 'Project' contract will need to include:
        - Milestones, Tasks, Sub-tasks, Status, dedicated comments feed
        - Escrow System securing payment
    - Each 'Project contract' must be managed by 
        - a simple user
        - a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
        allowing to change status, execute payments, etc.

- **User Interface & Product Design**
    - Design the v0.1 of the Product as 'read only' 
    - Design the Project Manager as 'organisation'
    - Design the project as 'candidate' to a Grant

- **Front end development**
    - Develop the v0.1 of the Product as 'read only' (simple user)
    - Develop the Project Manager as 'Organisation'
    - Develop the Project as 'candidate' to a Grant

- **Connections**
    - Allow users to use Adena to connect & interact with product
    - Link Tasks in the Dashboard to Github repository (PRs)

- **Create Documentations**
    - Gno Escrow System Contracts Documentation for Developers
    - Gno Conflict Solver Documentation for Developers
    - Product Presentation (Article/Blog)
    - Create a Demo for Community (Video) 
    - Document the journey on Hackerspace Github Repo

- **Interactions with others Modules**
    - allow auto-publishing Grants updates on the Social feed by the DAO wallet
    - display all grants in the Teritori Interface

#### Included contributions
- **Conflict Resolution Framework v0.1 (former-Justice DAO Module)** 
this module will allow to solve a conflict between buyer and seller by calling a choosen external authority as judge. 
This module is necessary to elaborate solutions for conflicts and must be built with a modular, future-proof, and secure approach that could be a large range of usecases. 

This Module could select an 'authority' to judge the conflict situation without any major conflict of interest. 
Authority could be define by both users before the contract validation, and could be different kind of contracts:
> Ex #1: Justice DAO: pickup random people in a whitelisted list (based on proof of contribution, or token holders, etc.)
> Ex #2: an Onchain game? Solve the conflict playing Chess
> Ex #3: choose a specific multisig adress managed by a company to solve the conflict
> Ex #4: use an external oracle to solve the conflict


- **Side contributions on Gno core topics & Dev tools**
The team will continue to identify useful tools for developers, to facilitate the onboarding of future developers within the Gno ecosystem.
For example, the list of interesting topics we'd like to continue contributing to:
    - VRF (*Verifiable Random Function)
        > https://github.com/TERITORI/gno/pull/10
    - GnoLS
        - support current developers working on it
    - GnoVM topics
        - research & experimentations: we'll open clean reports on bugs we encounter
